## Official description

### About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
### Learning outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Java. Challenge yourself with loops and conditions, practice working with classes, and get more confident in Java.
### This project is a part of the following tracks
"Java for Beginners" "Java Desktop Application Developer" "Java Backend Developer" "Java Core" "Java Developer"
### What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
- Stage 1/6 Making coffee:
Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!
- Stage 2/6 Ingredient calculator:
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
- Stage 3/6 Estimate the number of servings:
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.
- Stage 4/6 Buy, fill, take!:
Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
- Stage 5/6 Keep track of the supplies:
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.
- Stage 6/6 Brush up your code:
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
